      An SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle) combines the
      characteristics of a car and an off-road vehicle.
      It's popular for its higher ground clearance
      and more cargo space, making it suitable for
      outdoor activities and urban driving.

      A Coupe is a two-door car, typically with a
      sporty design. It is known for its sleek and
      stylish appearance, though it often has less
      rear-seat space compared to a sedan.
